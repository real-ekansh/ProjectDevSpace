## ROM (Read-Only Media) software refers to a type of software that runs on a computer or other device, often in a read-only format. This can include:

**Operating Systems:** Such as Android, iOS, or Windows
Firmware: Software that controls the device's hardware, such as a router or modem
Bootloaders: Software that loads the operating system or firmware into memory
Types of ROM Software
**1. Custom ROMs**
Modified versions of the standard operating system, often with additional features or improvements
Can be created by developers or enthusiasts, and may offer more control or customization options
**2. Stock ROMs**
Official versions of the operating system, provided by the manufacturer or developer
Typically include the standard features and settings, with minimal customization options
**3. ROM Porting**
A Port ROM is a customized version of a ROM (Read-Only Media) software that has been adapted to run on a specific device or platform. It is a modified version of the original ROM software, tailored to meet the unique requirements and specifications of the target device.

1. Kernel Development
Creating or modifying the kernel, which is the core of the operating system
Requires knowledge of low-level programming and system architecture

2. Application Development
Creating software applications that run on top of the operating system
Can be done using a variety of programming languages and frameworks 

3. ROM Porting
Adapting the ROM software to run on a different device or platform
Requires knowledge of the device's hardware and software architecture
Code Example: Simple ROM Software
